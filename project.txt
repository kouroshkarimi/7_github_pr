This is another change for testing auto pr update.
Bellow I wrote a matrix multiplication code you can use:

def manual_matrix_multiply(A, B):
    rows_A = len(A)
    cols_A = len(A[0])
    rows_B = len(B)
    cols_B = len(B[0])

    # Check if multiplication is possible
    if cols_A != rows_B:
        raise ValueError("Matrix dimensions do not match!")

    # Create result matrix filled with zeros
    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]

    # Triple loop multiplication
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            for k in range(cols_A):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]

    return result
